Established planning areas in the east remain heavily populated, while pronounced demographic differences exist between mature and newer estates. These patterns have significant implications for urban planning priorities including: (1) targeted healthcare infrastructure development in aging neighborhoods like Outram and Bukit Merah; (2) transit connectivity improvements to address population concentration in eastern regions; and (3) housing policy adaptations to accommodate evolving household structures across different planning areas."
