# Our Storyboard

This storyboard presents a design prototype for a Shiny dashboard that allows users to explore the influence and evolution of the Oceanus Folk music genre, with a focus on emerging artists and shifting patterns of musical collaboration. The visual analytics features are derived from the MC1 knowledge graph and aim to offer meaningful insights into the genre's reach, trajectory, and cultural impact.

The purpose of this storyboard is twofold:

To **showcase the key user interface (UI) components and visualizations** that would be included in the Shiny app. To **guide the user experience** by explaining what each chart reveals and how it helps answer specific analytical questions.

While this prototype does not require working code, it reflects the logic, visual design, and interactivity that a functional Shiny app would offer. Each section corresponds to a specific insight goal from Mini-Challenge 1 (MC1) and is structured with:

A **heading** indicating the analytical question addressed A **screenshot or sketch** of the visualization A **short narrative** explaining the insight and how a user might interact with the component

This storyboard focuses on the following key analytical goals:

1.  Tracking how the **Oceanus Folk genre spread** over time and into other musical styles
2.  Understanding whether the influence was **intermittent or steady**
3.  Identifying the **top genres and artists influenced** by Oceanus Folk
4.  Exploring how **Sailor Shift's rise contributed** to the genre's transformation
5.  Profiling **rising stars** based on influence metrics
6.  Comparing the **career trajectories** of three selected artists
7.  Predicting **future Oceanus Folk stars** based on influence patterns

Together, these sections simulate a user's journey through the dashboard, enabling exploration of complex musical data through intuitive and insightful visual design.

## MC1 Question 1: Sailor Shift Career Profile Analysis

### Section: Career Timeline Analysis

This visualization transforms the static career timeline from Take-home 2 into an interactive exploration tool.

## MC1 Question 2: Spread of Oceanus Folk Influence Over Time

### Section: Timeline of Oceanus Folk Influence

This section visualizes how the Oceanus Folk genre has expanded its influence over the years through stylistic, lyrical, and compositional connections.

The line graph demonstrates the **number of songs or artists influenced by Oceanus Folk each year**, based on relationships such as `InStyleOf`, `LyricalReferenceTo`, and `InterpolatesFrom`.

This timeline allows users to: Observe the **rate of genre adoption** across decades, Detect **spikes in influence** (e.g., due to major album releases), Understand whether influence was **gradual** or **intermittent**.

### Mockup Preview

**Interpretation:** The influence of Oceanus Folk shows a significant rise post-2005 and maintains consistent outreach, suggesting steady integration into mainstream and niche genres alike.

### Influence Timeline: Oceanus Folk's Cultural Expansion

This panel visualizes how the Oceanus Folk genre gradually spread its influence through the music world over time. Using the knowledge graph's relationship edges such as `InStyleOf`, `LyricalReferenceTo`, and `InterpolatesFrom`, we identify songs and artists that stylistically or lyrically reflect Oceanus Folk traditions.

The timeline is plotted as a year-by-year count of influenced songs/artists, allowing users to trace patterns of genre adoption.

**User Interaction Features (Storyboard Design):** A sidebar with section tabs for **Overview**, **Influencer Timeline**, and **Genre Trends**. The active chart window displays the **line plot of influenced works by year**. In a real dashboard, users could apply **genre filters** or **node type switches** (e.g., "songs only", "artists only") to explore influence depth.

**Interpretation:** The timeline reveals that Oceanus Folk's influence began modestly in the 1980s, followed by a **noticeable rise post-2000**. This growth is consistent with a genre that evolved organically, gaining popularity through indirect influence rather than sudden viral trends.

The peak around 2006–2010 suggests a period of cultural saturation, after which the influence remained steady with periodic spikes — possibly due to standout albums or collaborative trends.

This visualization supports the insight that Oceanus Folk's spread was **gradual and sustained**, rather than **intermittent or random**.
